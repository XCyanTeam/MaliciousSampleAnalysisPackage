# Registry Toolkit has several special registry switches that are
# available for advanced usage. All of these switches except the
# toolbar style switch have counterparts for use during script
# operations. We present the information below (in REGEDIT4 style)
# in case you need to use any of them during interactive use through
# the graphical interface.

# If you are doing a script operation it is NOT necessary to make
# any change to the Windows registry settings for the program.
# Script-based switches over-ride default settings for
# the program.

# Below are some special registry switches available in 
# Registry Toolkit version 3.6+

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\funduc Software Inc.\Registry Toolkit\Settings]
# *** SET VALUE DATA ***
# To write the replace string where a value is found, set this value
# to the data type desired for the value ie:
# REG_SZ                      ( 1 )   // Unicode nul terminated string
# REG_EXPAND_SZ               ( 2 )   // Unicode nul terminated string
#                                     // (with environment variable references)
# REG_BINARY                  ( 3 )   // Free form binary
# REG_DWORD                   ( 4 )   // 32-bit number
# REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN     ( 4 )   // 32-bit number (same as REG_DWORD)
# REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN        ( 5 )   // 32-bit number
# REG_LINK                    ( 6 )   // Symbolic Link (unicode)
# REG_MULTI_SZ                ( 7 )   // Multiple Unicode strings
"Set Value Data"=dword:00000000

# *** FLAT TOOLBAR ***
# To be used if you wish to see regular toolbars instead of flat
# Uncomment line below and remove the one after
#"Flat Toolbar"=dword:00000000
"Flat Toolbar"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\funduc Software Inc.\Registry Toolkit\Settings]
# *** SETTINGS FILE PATH ***
# Path to settings file.  Usually set to a path on a user's machine 
# if the program is installed on the network.
"Settings File"="C:\\tools\\RegTkt\\default.srt"

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\funduc Software Inc.\Registry Toolkit\Settings]
# *** UNDO FILE LIMIT ***
# To change the number of undo files the program maintains during
# interactive use, modify the dword value below.  The default is 
# decimal 10.  You can also modify this value by using Registry 
# Toolkit to edit the registry.  The program reads the value at 
# startup so exit and restart for a new setting to take effect.
"Maximum Undo Files"=dword:0000000a

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\funduc Software Inc.\Registry Toolkit\Settings]
# *** PROGRESS METER ***
# To disabled the progress meter during interactive program use,
# uncomment the line below and remove the one after. 
# This switch has no effect on script functionality. To disable
# the progress meter during scripts, add No Progress=1 to your
# script. See the program hlp and example scripts for more info
# on script switches.
# "No Progress"=dword:00000001
"No Progress"=dword:00000000

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\funduc Software Inc.\Registry Toolkit\Settings]
# *** PROCESS SUBKEYS ***
# By default the program will recurse all subkeys.  To 
# process values/data only in the immediate key specified 
# in the main dialog, use the Process Subkeys=0 
# switch.  Also see comments below about the use of 
# wild cards in the Key= specification.  You should 
# specify Process Subkeys=0 if you are using a wildcard 
# in Key= and want to confine the search to the exact key
# structure specified.
# "Process Subkeys"=dword:00000000
"Process Subkeys"=dword:00000001
