# This file describes the script syntax for Registry Toolkit v 3.6+

# General Comments
# ======================================================
# The # character in column 1 is the comment character. 
# These MUST go in column 1. 

# All switches must start in column 1.

# Scripts are divided into [Action ] sections that are 
# numbered sequentially, e.g, [Action01], [Action02], 
# [Action03], ....  They can be in any order in the 
# script but are processed sequentially by number.

# Scripts can also have an optional [Default] section.  
# [Default] can be used to specify switches that are to 
# be used in all [Action ] that do not have that same switch 
# specified.  A switch specified in an [Action ] always 
# overrides the counterpart (if any) from [Default].

# All scripts MUST have at least one [Action ] section.  
# For a single action script, DO NOT USE a [Default]
# section.  Use [Action1] instead. 

# If your script has multiple actions and if you are 
# using output file(s), use a different Output/Undo File= 
# specification for each [Action ].  File writes to the 
# output file are 'overwrite', not 'append'.

# See [Action3] below for an example of how to specify 
# multiple s/r's within a single [Action ].

# See F1 hlp for information on performing Exports via 
# a script.

[Default]

# Use this optional section to specify any switches to be
# applied to all [Action ]'s.  We suggest new users 
# omit [Default] entirely and specify all switches within 
# each [Action ].  You can streamline later if you want by 
# making a [Default]. 

[Action1]
# *** HIVE/HEY TO SEARCH ***
# Specify a top level key name to begin the operation from.
# Wild card characters * and ? can be used.  It is not necessary
# to enable Regular Expression mode.  The program will 
# automatically detect and use wild cards.  See last Action below
# for example.
# If you need to reference a remote registry, use UNC style 
# naming, e.g., Key=\\MainSrv1\HKEY_CURRENT_USER
# See F1 hlp for more info on Remote Registry.
Key=HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

# *** SEARCH AND REPALCE STRINGS ***
# It is OK to leave Replace String= blank when conducting 
# search-only operations.  Results of the search will be 
# written to the undo file.
# If you wish to use the undo file to preview the effects 
# of a replacement, enter a string in Replace String= and 
# specify Replace=0 (see below).
Search String=Funduc
Replace String=

# *** CASE SENSITIVE OPERATION ***
# 0 = Case Insensitive search
# 1 = Case Sensitive search
# If not specified, Default = 0
Case Sensitive=0

# *** WHOLE WORD OPERATION ***
# 0 = Whole Word matching for the search string off
# 1 = Whole Word matching search string on
# If not specified, Default = 0
Whole Word=0

# *** REGULAR EXPRESSION OPERATION ***
# See Registry Operations - Regular Expressions for more info.
# 0 = Regular Expression mode off
# 1 = Regular Expression mode on
# If not specified, Default = 0
Regular Expression=0

# *** OPERATIONS ON VALUES ***
# 0 = Do not search (or replace) in registry values
# 1 = Search (or replace) in registry values
# If not specified, Default = 0
Values=1

# *** OPERATIONS ON KEYS ***
# 0 = Do not search (or replace) registry keys
# 1 = Search (or replace) registry keys
# If not specified, Default = 0
Keys=1

# *** OPERATIONS ON DATA ***
# 0 = Do not search (or replace) data values
# 1 = Search (or replace) data values
# If not specified, Default = 0
Data=1

# *** OPERATIONS ON STRING DATA ***
# 0 = Do not search (or replace) REG_SZ data types
# 1 = Search (or replace) REG_SZ data types
# If not specified, Default = 0
String=1

# *** OPERATIONS ON EXPANDED STRING DATA ***
# 0 = Do not search (or replace) REG_EXPAND_SZ data types
# 1 = Search (or replace) REG_EXPAND_SZ data types
# If not specified, Default = 0
Expanded String=0

# *** OPERATIONS ON MUTLI LINE STRING DATA ***
# 0 = Do not search (or replace) REG_MULTI_SZ data types
# 1 = Search (or replace) REG_MULTI_SZ data types
# If not specified, Default = 0
Multi String=0

# *** OPERATIONS BINARY DATA ***
# 0 = Do not search REG_BINARY data types 
# 1 = Search REG_BINARY data types
# If not specified, Default = 0
Binary=0

# *** OPERATIONS DWORD DATA ***
# NOTES: 
# - This must be combined with Regular Expression=1
# - Use the hex notation form \0xXX where XX is the 
#   value to search for or replace with. Example, 
#   to search for decimal dword 1, use \0x01
# 0 = Do not search REG_DWORD data types 
# 1 = Search REG_DWORD data types
# If not specified, Default = 0
DWORD=0

# *** PROCESS SUBKEYS OR NOT ***
# By default the program will recurse all subkeys.  To 
# process values/data only in the immediate key specified 
# in the Key= switch above, use the Process Subkeys=0 
# switch.  Also see comments below about the use of 
# wild cards in the Key= specification.  You should 
# specify Process Subkeys=0 if you are using a wildcard 
# in Key= and want to confine the search to the exact key
# structure specified.
# 0 = Do not process subkeys
# 1 = Process Subkeys
Process Subkeys=1

# *** Undo Files Path= SPECIFICATION ***
# Use this switch to specify the path for undo/output file for 
# the script. It can be omitted but we do not recommend doing
# so. You can specify a different Undo Files Path= path for 
# each [ActionX] section in a multi-step script. The actual 
# Undo Files Path= written takes the form of a date & time named
# file ending in .reg for the name extension. 
# A machine environment variable can be used in the path string. 
# Use the syntax %%ENVVAR=variable name%%. (case insensitive)
# NUL (case insensitive) can be used for the file name to disable
# the dump for an action.
Undo Files Path=D:\Scripts\RTOutput1

# *** REPLACEMENT PROMPTING ***
# Note: When confirm is on, you may chose to skip all further 
# confirmations in the confirmation dialog after the first prompt 
# is offered. 
# 0 = No initial replacement confirmation
# 1 = Confirm replacement prompt supplied for first replacement
# If not specified, Default = 0
Prompts=1

# *** PERMIT REPLACEMENTS? ***
# Use this when you have a Replace String specified but just want 
# to preview the results of your replace.  The preview will be 
# listed in the Output/Undo File.
# 0 = No replace
# 1 = Perform a replace
# If not specified, Default = 0
Replace=0

# *** DISPLAY PROGRESS METER ***
# 0 = Standard progress meter
# 1 = No progress meter is displayed
# If not specified, Default = 0
No Progress=0

# *** WRITE REPLACEMENT STRING TO VALUE DATA ***
# To write the replace string where a value is found 
# by the search string instead of changing the value 
# itself, specify the data type with this switch. 
# In most cases you will not use any setting for this
# switch so leave it turned off or omit entirely.
# 1 = REG_SZ
# 2 = REG_EXPAND_SZ
# 3 = REG_BINARY
# 4 = REG_DWORD
# 4 = REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN
# 5 = REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN
# 6 = REG_LINK
# 7 = REG_MULTI_SZ
# If not specified, Default=0.

# Note that Regular Expression=0 is OK.  It is not necessary to

# Also note that if you want to search _only_ the exact level of 
# HKEY_USERS\S-*\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\PrinterPorts 
# Process Subkeys=0 should be specified.  If Process Subkeys=1 is 
# specified the program will also search keys under \PrinterPorts if
