1=Windows registry is its core, constantly modifying and growing in size. It is being altered each time you install/remove programs or config system settings. Such changes made to Windows registry cause it to grow in size, no matter whether new information is added or deleted from registry. Thus registry quickly loses its linear structure which results in increase of application response time and registry access time.*|**|*"Registry Defragmentation" performs physical defragmentation of the Windows registry file. After defragmentation your registry will acquire linear structure which will reduce application response time and registry access time.

5=System Backup is very useful when you want to perform a rollback to the previous state of your Windows.
