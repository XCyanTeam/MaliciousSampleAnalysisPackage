Unpacker_Aspack.exe - 1.0 ---- Released 2011 September, the 11th

This is a tool to unpack Aspack wrapped targets. Since this sort of packer is not difficult to unpack & dump, the goal of the tool is just to make your life a little bit easier when you are facing any Aspack target.

And of course it has been a good exercise about coding debuggers unsing Delphi environment.

The option 'Rebuild sections' allows a dump clean of any wrapper code, minimizes all sections and uncompresses also the resources section.
Unchecking this option makes a dump without any further processing.

Supported dll files also. This tool retrieves the entire relocations section whilst debugging the process.

drag&drop feature available.

All troubles found when unpacking any target, please let me know in any of the reversing forums where this tool could have been released.

Thanks to all! And I hope you enjoy it.
